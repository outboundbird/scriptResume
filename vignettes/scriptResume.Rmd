`scriptResume` is a R addin package that aims to facilitate the R coding exprience.
It is especially useful when combining with keyboard short cuts.
Currently, there are two section of functions implemented.


## Editing functions

These addin functions help to facilitate coding process.

- Objects to quoted text
- Remove row ID
- Upper case
- Lower case
- Roxygen comment
- Roxygen uncomment
- Roxygen quote
- to bullet point
- to table

### Copy n paste related features
`Object to quoted text`

`Remove row ID` remove the row IDs from the text copied from the console.

```
 [1] "1 m = 722"   "10 m = 584"  "11 m = 427"  "12 m = 380"
 [5] "13 m = 243"  "14 m = 211"  "15 m = 321"  "16 m = 316"
 [9] "17 m = 220"  "18 m = 152"  "19 m = 1906" "2 m = 737"
[13] "20 m = 164"  "21 m = 108"  "22 m = 269"  "3 m = 507"
[17] "4 m = 498"   "5 m = 412"   "6 m = 7836"  "7 m = 569"
[21] "8 m = 379"   "9 m = 297"
```
to
```
  "1 m = 722"   "10 m = 584"  "11 m = 427"  "12 m = 380"
  "13 m = 243"  "14 m = 211"  "15 m = 321"  "16 m = 316"
  "17 m = 220"  "18 m = 152"  "19 m = 1906" "2 m = 737"
 "20 m = 164"  "21 m = 108"  "22 m = 269"  "3 m = 507"
 "4 m = 498"   "5 m = 412"   "6 m = 7836"  "7 m = 569"
 "8 m = 379"   "9 m = 297"
```

`Upper case` and `Lower case`

### Roxygen formatting features

These features are used in the R script instead of R Markdown files. They will
transform the text into Roxygen format comment or quoted text in Roxygen format.
Alternatively it can back-tranform a chunk of Roxygen comment format text back
to text in R script.

`Roxygen comment`: e.g.
from
`This is my comment.`
to
`#' This is my comment.`

`Roxygen uncomment`: e.g. from `#' Recommenting` to `Recommenting`

`Roxygen quote`: e.g. from `Some quotes` to `#' > Some quotes`

### Markdown related features

`to bullet point` transform
```
point 1
point 2
point 3
```
to

 - point 1
 - point 2
 - point 3

`to table` transform a colon separated entry into `md` table format. For example,

```
a:b:c
1:2:3
4:5:6
```
to

|a|b|c|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|2|3|
|4|5|6|

## Script reading functions
These addin functions read through the currently active script and summarize the script.
The functions include:

- Insert unique libraries
- Insert header

### Insert unique libraries

This function reads through the script and collects the libraries used throughout
the script. The function will collect libraries called by
`library()`, `require()`, `lib::` and insert these libraries at current cursor
position. It will automatically remove duplicated usage of the same library.
For example,

```
require(abc)
libraries(abc)
xyz::xyz()
```
to

```
library(abc)
library(knitr)
library(lib)
library(rmarkdown)
library(xyz)
```
The other libraries are used in this Rmd file but not shown in this example.

### Insert header

This function read through the currently active R script and summarize the script
with following information of the current computing enviroment:


```

Files imported with funcitons `read_xx()`, `load()` will be collected

```
data1 <- read.csv("data/file1.csv")
data2 <- readRDS("data/file2.Rds")
load("data/file3.Rda")
source("src/preprocess.R")
```

Files exported with functions `write_xx()`, `save*()` will be collected.

```
write.csv(data2, "data/file2.csv")
saveRDS(file3, "data/file3.Rds")
```

Since this function is targeted at pharma industry, it will automatically read
the current working directory ant output the triplet information. This illustration
is tested in local so this function is not shown in the output.
