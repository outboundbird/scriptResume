`scriptResume` is a R addin package that aims to facilitate the coding process.
It comes especially handy after combined with keyboard short cuts.
Currently, there are two section of functions implemented - editing functions and
script reading functions.


## Editing functions

These addin functions help to facilitate coding process.

- Objects to quoted text
- Remove row ID
- Upper case
- Lower case
- Remove quotes
- Roxygen comment
- Roxygen uncomment
- Roxygen quote
- to bullet point
- to table

### Copy & paste related features

`Object to quoted text` transforms a chunk of selected text with comma separator into
a string vector. For example,
from
```
a, b, c, d
```
to
```
c("a", "b", "c", "d")
```

`Remove row ID` remove the row IDs from the text copied from the console.

```
 [1] "1 m = 722"   "10 m = 584"  "11 m = 427"  "12 m = 380"
 [5] "13 m = 243"  "14 m = 211"  "15 m = 321"  "16 m = 316"
 [9] "17 m = 220"  "18 m = 152"  "19 m = 1906" "2 m = 737"
[13] "20 m = 164"  "21 m = 108"  "22 m = 269"  "3 m = 507"
[17] "4 m = 498"   "5 m = 412"   "6 m = 7836"  "7 m = 569"
[21] "8 m = 379"   "9 m = 297"
```
to
```
  "1 m = 722"   "10 m = 584"  "11 m = 427"  "12 m = 380"
  "13 m = 243"  "14 m = 211"  "15 m = 321"  "16 m = 316"
  "17 m = 220"  "18 m = 152"  "19 m = 1906" "2 m = 737"
 "20 m = 164"  "21 m = 108"  "22 m = 269"  "3 m = 507"
 "4 m = 498"   "5 m = 412"   "6 m = 7836"  "7 m = 569"
 "8 m = 379"   "9 m = 297"
```

`remove quotes` function will remove any quotation marks in the selected text, e.g. it will change `"A",'B'` to `A, B`.

`Upper case` and `Lower case` transform the selected text into upper or lower cased format.

### Roxygen formatting features

These features are used in the R script instead of R Markdown files. They will
transform the selected text into Roxygen format comment or quoted text in Roxygen format.
Alternatively it can back-tranform a chunk of Roxygen comment format text back
to text in R script.

`Roxygen comment`: e.g.
from
`This is my comment.`
to
`#' This is my comment.`

`Roxygen uncomment`: e.g. from `#' Recommenting` to `Recommenting`

`Roxygen quote`: e.g. from `Some quotes` to `#' > Some quotes`

### Markdown related features

`to bullet point` transforms selected text into bullet points. The selected text
has to be separated by `\n`.
```
point 1
point 2
point 3
```
to

 - point 1
 - point 2
 - point 3

`to table` transforms selected text, which is colon separated entry into `md` table format. For example,

```
a:b:c
1:2:3
4:5:6
```
to

|a|b|c|
| --- | --- | --- |
|1|2|3|
|4|5|6|

## Script reading functions
These addin functions read through the currently active script and summarize the script.
The functions include:

- Insert unique libraries
- Insert header

### Unique libraries

This function reads through the script and collects the libraries used throughout
the script. The function will collect libraries called by
`library()`, `require()`, `lib::` and insert these libraries at current cursor
position. It will automatically remove duplicated usage of the same library.
For example,

```
require(abc)
libraries(abc)
xyz::xyz()
```
to

```
library(abc)
library(knitr)
library(lib)
library(rmarkdown)
library(xyz)
```
The other libraries are used in this Rmd file but not shown in this example.
You will find this function handy when reading a messy script that the libraries
are imported from every possible random place.

### A header summary of a script

This function read through the currently active R script and summarize the script
with following information of the current computing enviroment, hence the name of the package `scriptResume`.

Files imported with funcitons `read*()`, `load()`, `source()` will be collected

```
data1 <- read.csv("data/file1.csv")
data2 <- readRDS("data/file2.Rds")
load("data/file3.Rda")
source("src/preprocess.R")
```

Files exported with functions `write*()`, `save*()` will be collected.

```
write.csv(data2, "data/file2.csv")
saveRDS(file3, "data/file3.Rds")
```

Since this function is targeted at pharma industry, it will automatically read
the current working directory and output the triplet information. This illustration
is tested in local so this function is not shown in the output above.

Below is an example for a dummy directory. Since I'm always working on biomarker analysis, the analysis code always starts with BMK.

```
# Author           : e123456
# Compound number  : SAR123
# Study code       : LPS123
# Analysis code    : BMK-CSR
```

## R markdown theme

Starting from version 0.1.5, An Addin function, `make css` will be available for generating a predefined-themed `css` file. To use this function, put the cursor in the any open R script or any type of file, which defines currently active document, then click on the `make css` button. A css file named `theme.css` will be generated in the directory of the current active document.

## Project environment

### Sourcing triplet environment

Starting from version 0.1.6, this addin has a new feature for sourcing the triplet environment. Placing the cursor in the file that is located in a triplet environment then click on the button of `source triplet` in the addin. The current working environment will be changed to the triplet environment the active file is located.

### Create a project environment
The `Setup Project` button will create a subdirectory in the current active file directory. e.g.
```
|- data
|- output
|- src
     |-pkg_install.R
     |- requirements.txt
.gitignore
README
```
